# Design Patterns - Implimented in Ruby

This is code for a talk I gave for Springs.rb.

Heavily influenced by:

> Design Patterns
> Elements of Reusabled Object-Oriented Software
> By: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides

## What is a Design Pattern?

Design patterns are used as solutions to common problems within OO programming. They have four parts:

1. Pattern name
2. Problem
3. Solution
4. Consequences

## Categorizations

There are fundamentally three groupings of patterns:

1. Creational Patterns - deal with object creation
2. Structural Patterns - composition of classes or objects
3. Behavioral Patterns - how classes or objects interact and distribute responsibilities

## What is this project?

I wanted to give code examples for each. But truthfully, code is the least important part of a DP. Understanding what it is and why you are using it is more important. So while I'll try to cover some of that in the readme, the book is _much_ better at it than I am.

I'm going to cover 4 of the 23 + 2 more:

* Builder
* Singleton
* Decorator
* Observer
* Delegation
* Concerns
