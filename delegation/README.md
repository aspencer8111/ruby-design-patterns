# Delegation

Jim Gay [argues](http://www.saturnflyer.com/blog/jim/2012/07/06/the-gang-of-four-is-wrong-and-you-dont-understand-delegation/) that the term "Delegation" is used wrong. I'll let you read his arguments.

Most people refer to delegation as a way to delegate some tasks of an object to another class. This boils down to simply message forwarding.

[Robert Zotter](http://www.fromjavatoruby.com/2008/10/delgation-in-ruby.html) goes through a few ways of implimenting delgation including [ActiveRecord Delegation](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_core_extensions.html#method-delegation).
