# Singleton

> Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

Probably the #1 design pattern people say not to use, but you should still know what it is. And sometimes, you'll even find a legitament use for it.

Via Stackoverflow, a [Singleton](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/228164/on-design-patterns-when-to-use-the-singleton) must satisfy these three:

* controls concurrent access to a shared resource.
* access to the resource will be requested from multiple, disparate parts of the system.
* there can be only one object.
